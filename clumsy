“In archery, when you’re betting tiles on your shots, you perform with skill. 
When you’re betting fancy clasps, you grow cautious. 
When the bet is for gold, you’re a nervous wreck. 
Your skill is the same – but when the prize means a lot to you, you let outside considerations weigh on you. 
One who values what’s outside gets clumsy on the inside.”
